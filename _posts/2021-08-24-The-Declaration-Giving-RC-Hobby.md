The senior high period is usually busy and lack of spare time. In contrast, RC hobby tends to be time consuming, not suitable for that period mentioned above. What's more, it won't be so time consuming if you do not crash your RC model, or if there's never anything wrong with it; however, things usually do not go that smoothly. 

Running into problems such as motor failure, unexpectable cable disconnection, RX loss and even damage or injury can be very normal, and of course, in those cases, you would need to fix the model mostly on your own; you would be shopping for screws, propellers, 3D printed add-ons; or even new ESC controller, motherboard; or even new motors if worse, after which it would be time for HUGE amount of repairing work; again after which the "repaired" component would be in need of testing, adjusting and assembling, AGAIN after which, EVENTUALLY, time to test fly; it would be very lucky for you if there is nothing wrong left for you to go into, though the fact is, it is highly possible that there is a NEW BUG! 

Per those inconveniences, it is time to faithfully declare a temporary goodbye to RC hobby. Some may think that it is better to sell all equipments in order to prevent loss of value, while I do not have the plan to sell them to others simply because they won't sell well (they don't worth much money but cost one too much time to sell them). So I just keep them.

# OPERATION

1. **EQUIPMENTS.** Pack all (except FEIYUSKY controller) equipments in one storage space.
2. **AUXILIARY APPS.**
    * Uninstall all mobile auxiliary apps: Betaflight Configurator/Speedy Bee, etc.
    * Uninstall all desktop auxiliary softwares: Betaflight Configurator, BLHeli Configurator, etc.
        * *Including all drivers, and Zadig.* (Do a backup as per below.)
    * For those really in need of keeping a copy, back them up, contain a link to official website, and zip to a file; then zip all sub zipped files into one. **Set the password as the S/N of HW-200325CP0 adaptor.**
3. **VIDEO CLIPS.** For flying video clips, consider storing to Baidu Netdisk, or just delete them. Adobe Premiere doesn't necessarily have to be uninstalled. Keeping it will be fine.
4. **ACCESS.** Before gaokao, no one has access to those materials. Access exception should be normally denied; if really necessary, exceptions must be logged here. The highest amount of exception is 1 time/4 months.
5. **COMMUNITY & COMMUNICATION.** It is not strictly necessary to leave related QQ groups, since a full block on them would be enough to filter their messages.
6. **EFFECT.** The operation should be in effect no later than 2020-08-26.  
The last day of this operation keeping effective is the last day of gaokao.
